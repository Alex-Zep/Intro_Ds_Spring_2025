The "Alexandra_Zeppeiro_Proj2_I.ipynb" file is Part 1 of Project 2: In this project, I analyzed county-level population data across the U.S. to explore patterns related to race, gender, and geography. I found that the Black population is heavily concentrated in places like D.C., Mississippi, and Maryland, while states like Maine and Montana have much smaller Black populations. This likely reflects historical and economic factors, especially urbanization.
I also noticed that many counties have more women than men, possibly due to women moving to cities for jobs in fields like healthcare and education. I looked at how population is spread out across counties and found that a few large cities skew the national average, meaning most counties are actually small.
Another important part of the analysis was comparing the number of Black and White residents. In states like Mississippi, there are more Black residents than White on average, which is the opposite of what we see in places like Utah. I also looked at patterns like how many counties each state has—Texas, for example, has far more than most.
Finally, I examined female population totals by state, which mostly follow overall population size—bigger states like California and Texas have more women. 

The "Alexandra_Zeppeiro_project2.ipynb"  is an analysis of county-level demographic data from the U.S. Census to explore how race, gender, and population are distributed across the United States. I began by importing and inspecting the dataset, checking for missing values or duplicates, and confirming the data was clean and ready for analysis. I then created visualizations—like histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots—to better understand patterns in the data. I focused especially on the Black or African American population, examining which states had the highest average counts and percentages. I also compared male and female populations, looked at how total population varied by county, and explored the number of counties in each state. To dig deeper, I calculated the Black-to-White population ratio and visualized it against total population to uncover more nuanced regional trends. Throughout the project, I used tools like groupby() and Seaborn to help uncover insights and tell a visual story about demographic diversity across the country.

For the Alexandra_Zeppeiro_Final.ipynb I  explored a rich dataset of Olympic athletes to uncover patterns in participation, representation, and medal-winning performance, with a particular focus on gender and sport-specific dynamics. Through data cleaning, visual exploration, and targeted questions, we traced how Olympic involvement has evolved—especially for women—and how certain countries and body types dominate specific athletic disciplines.
 We saw that male athletes historically outnumbered female athletes, but since the late 20th century, the gender gap has narrowed significantly, especially in medal-winning opportunities. Our visualizations showed that sports like Athletics, Swimming, and Gymnastics have consistently led in female medal counts, reflecting both growing access and the expansion of events for women.
Digging deeper, we found that female swimmer medalists were most concentrated in a few countries—especially the United States and Australia—suggesting that access to training infrastructure and national sports funding continues to shape Olympic outcomes. BMI analysis across sports also revealed how physical demands vary by discipline, with distinct body types excelling in different arenas.
These findings highlight the complexity behind Olympic success. It's not just about natural talent—opportunity, history, and investment all play major roles in shaping who competes, who wins, and what sports dominate the global stage. This analysis doesn’t just tell us who won, but why those wins matter and how broader social forces shape the meaning of the Olympics itself.
athlete_events.csv and noc_regions.csv are the original files used for the Final Project. 

cleaned_olympic_data.csv was the cleaned data and a merged dataset of the previous csv files.

demographic_data.csv is the dataset used for Project 2. The data was already cleaned, do I didnt need a second csv file.
